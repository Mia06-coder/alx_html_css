## Purpose

This project is part of the ALX Front-End curriculum and aims to demonstrate mastery of **semantic HTML**, **custom CSS styling**, **responsive design principles**, and **web accessibility**, without relying on external libraries.

---

## Project Overview

The landing page replicates a provided UI/UX design and adapts seamlessly across devices. It includes interactive elements like `hover` and `active` states for links and buttons, and adheres to a `max content width` of 1000px centered in the viewport.

---

## Features

- Pixel-perfect layout based on designer specifications
- Responsive design (mobile view at 480px and below)
- Semantic and accessible HTML structure
- Custom CSS styling without any frameworks
- Interactive button and link states (hover/active)
- No external CSS libraries

---

## Functional Requirements

- The page switches to a **mobile version** at screen widths ≤ 480px
- All **content** is max 1000px wide and **centered**
- **Links** change color to `#FF6565` on `:hover` and `:active`
- **Buttons** reduce `opacity to 0.9` on `:hover` and `:active`
- Page is fully functional using only **HTML** and **CSS**
- No use of external CSS frameworks

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Fully `responsive` across various screen sizes
- `WCAG-compliant` for accessibility (semantic tags, alt text, keyboard navigability)
- Clean, maintainable, and well-structured code
- Uses `BEM` or consistent class naming for scalability
- Cross-browser compatibility (tested on Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
